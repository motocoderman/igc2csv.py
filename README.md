Python script to convert IGC files to CSV with Python. Output includes I-Record defined added fields 
for B-Records and J-Record defined added fields for K-Records. CSV versions of B-Records and K-Records 
output to different files. Timestamps convert to ISO Date-times, and assume the availability of an HFDTEDATE:
