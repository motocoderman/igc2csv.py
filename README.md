# igc2csv.py
Python script to convert IGC files to CSV with Python. I-Records define added fields for B-Records 
and J-Records define added fields for K-Records. CSV versions of B-Records and K-Records output to 
different files. Timestamps convert to ISO Date-times, and assume the availability of an HFDTEDATE:
record in the IGC file.
